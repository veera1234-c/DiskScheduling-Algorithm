    <div class="intro">
        <p>
            In SSTF (Shortest Seek Time First), requests having shortest seek time are executed first.
            So, the seek time of every request is calculated in advance in the queue and then they are scheduled according to their calculated seek time.
            As a result, the request near the disk arm will get executed first.
            SSTF is certainly an improvement over FCFS as it decreases the average response time and increases the throughput of system.

            <h2>Algorithm of SSTF:</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Let Request array represents an array storing indexes of tracks that have been requested. ‘head’ is the position of disk head.</li>
                <li>Find the positive distance of all tracks in the request array from head.</li>
                <li>Find a track from requested array which has not been accessed/serviced yet and has minimum distance from head.</li>
                <li>Increment the total seek count with this distance.</li>
                <li>Currently serviced track position now becomes the new head position.</li>
                <li>Go to step 2 until all tracks in request array have not been serviced.</li>
            </ol>
        </div>
        <h3>Advantages of SSTF Disk scheduling Algorithm:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Average Response Time decreases</li>
            <li>Throughput increases</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Disadvantages of SSTF Disk scheduling Algorithm:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Overhead to calculate seek time in advance</li>
            <li>Can cause Starvation for a request if it has higher seek time as compared to incoming requests</li>
            <li>High variance of response time as SSTF favours only some requests</li>
        </ul><br><br>
